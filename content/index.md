# Why Frontend Development Sucks
## Front-end Development is the Worst

Look, front-end development is for script kiddies and soydevs who can't handle the real programming. I mean, it's just a bunch of divs and spans, right? And css??? It's like, "Oh, I want this to be red, but not thaaaaat red." What a joke.

Real programmers code, not silly markup languages. They use Arch Linux, not Mac OS, and certainly not Windows. They use Vim, not VS Code. They use C, not HTML. Come to the [backend](https://www.boot.dev) where the real programming happens.
