# several key areas you should consider testing:

1. Markdown Conversion:
 - Ensure your markdown files are being correctly converted to HTML. Test various markdown elements (headings, lists, links, images, etc.).
2. File and Directory Handling:
 - Test the generator's ability to read source files from different directories and ensure the output is correctly placed in the destination directory.
3. Template Rendering:
 - If you're using templates for your HTML, ensure that the placeholders are correctly replaced with the actual content from your markdown files.
4. Static Asset Handling:
 - Verify that static assets like images and CSS files are correctly copied to the output directory and referenced properly in your HTML files.
5. Link Verification:
 - Ensure that internal links are valid and point to the correct locations.
6. Edge Cases:
 - Test how your generator handles empty files, missing files, invalid markdown, and large files.
7. CLI Functionality:
 - If your project includes a command-line interface, ensure that it correctly parses command-line arguments and behaves as expected for valid, invalid, and edge case inputs.
8. Performance:
 - While not strictly necessary for correctness, testing the performance to ensure your generator can handle a reasonable number of files without excessive delay can be beneficial.
9. To put it into practice:
 - Unit Tests: Test individual functions, like markdown conversion or file reading/writing.
 - Integration Tests: Run the generator on sample directories with known input and expected output to ensure all parts work together.
 - Mocking: Use mocks or temporary directories (e.g., with pytest and tmpdir) for testing file operations without affecting the real filesystem.
